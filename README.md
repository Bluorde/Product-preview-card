This project is a solution to the **Product Description Card** challenge provided by **Frontend Mentor**. The goal is to create a responsive product card using HTML and CSS, where users can view a product image, its description, pricing details, and interact with buttons (such as add to cart or similar functionality). The project is focused on front-end development skills, specifically HTML and CSS layout, responsive design, and best practices.
